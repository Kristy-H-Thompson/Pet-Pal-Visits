                <h3>Jasper & Sharkie</h3>
                <p> I would give Matthew a million stars! Hands down the perfect pet sitter for our fur babies. I absolutely know that Patches our sweet kitty was the easiest to take care of haha, while the timid Jasper (our Aussiedoodle) was a challenge that Matthew accepted.</p>
                <p> I believe that Jasper did progress quite well with lots of patience and work from Matthew. </p>
                <p> Matthew handled everything (including surprises) with ease and attention to detail. </p>
                <p> I highly recommend Matthew‚Äôs services and will certainly use him again. </p>

                <h3>Great Job</h3>
                <p> Matthew and Josie took care of my 2 dogs, my cat, and all 7,000 of my plants for a week while we went on vacation.</p>
                <p> My cat is very weary of strangers but she actually made some rare appearances for Josie‚ô•Ô∏è </p> 
                <p> Both Matthew and Josie were very amazing to send me so many updates while we were gone. They even made funny videos with my dogsü§£which made us laugh hysterically each time we got a new one!!! </p>
                <p> They take plenty of photos and videos of your pets. Matthew and Josie even left our TV on during the day so the dogs wouldn‚Äôt be in ‚Äúsilence‚Äù- something I didn‚Äôt think aboutü•πüôà </p>
                <p> 5 stars! Matthew also took care of my pets last summer and we had the same amazing experience. Both Matthew and Josie have professional animal handling experience and it‚Äôs so relieving to have pet sitters who go the extra mile. Making sure doors are locked, gates are closed, plants are watered, etc.</p>
                <p> They were very flexible when it came to adapting to our animals routines and I truly never worried about my pets for a second.</p>

                <h3>Bo, Duke, Maisey Ana & Zeke</h3>
                <p> Matthew did such a wonderful job with my pups (and there‚Äôs a lot of them). I got daily updates and he left me a detailed chart of what times they got fed and got their meds. He even was sure to take great care of them when he got sick while I was away. My house was as clean when I got home despite the rain causing mud my dogs inevitably brought in the house. He played fetch with them, and even caught when one of my older dogs had just an ever so slight limp. He dried them off when they came inside from the rain. 100% recommend Matthew. He accurately medicated my epileptic Aussie (who is also blind and deaf). Bo Duke Maisey Ana and Zeke give him 5 stars!

                <p>Matthew was great with Peanut and Humphrey. I knew they were in good hands with Pet Pal Visits With Matthew. Our house was also clean! We look forward to having him come back soon.

                <h3>Mina</h3>
                <p>Matthew did a great job with our Mina. She is not a friendly cat, especially not with strangers. Matthew babied her enough that she accepted him, especially when he called her name and gave her treats.

                <h3>Paisley & Beanie</h3>
                <p> Matthew is a Dog Whisperer! I needed him to help my girl pup who had surgery on her knee to go out for potty while I was away during a few long days at a convention. That‚Äôs all I needed him to do. Everyday he came he carried her ( 9 years old) down our steps to the backyard. The one ‚Äú problem‚Äù could have been our yappy one year old miniature poodle Beanie, who wasn‚Äôt sure what Matthew was doing in HIS house. üòÇ Matthew not only took Paisley out for potty but played with Beanie until Beanie was literally putty in his hands. Matthew is delightful, prompt and goes the extra mile to take care of all the needs of a pet. I don‚Äôt trust my kids to just anybody. I can recommend him in a minute and if you want to PM me I can tell you more about this magical man.
